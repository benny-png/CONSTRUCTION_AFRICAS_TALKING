## API Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoint categories:

- **Authentication** (`/auth/*`): User registration, login, and token management
- **Users** (`/users/*`): User management, filtering by roles (clients, managers, workers)
- **Projects** (`/projects/*`): Project creation, management, and progress tracking
- **Inventory** (`/inventory/*`): Inventory item management
- **Requests** (`/requests/*`): Worker requests for inventory items
- **Expenses** (`/expenses/*`): Expense tracking and receipt management
- **Material Usage** (`/material-usage/*`): Tracking material consumption
- **Notifications** (`/notifications/*`): User notifications
- **AI Assistance** (`/ai/*`): AI-powered tools and analysis

For detailed endpoint specifications, refer to the Swagger UI documentation available at `/docs` when the API is running.

## User Management Features

The API includes several user management endpoints:

### Get All Users (Manager only)
```
GET /users/
```
Retrieve a list of all users in the system.

### Get User by ID (Manager only)
```

These endpoints allow filtering users by their role, accessible to any authenticated user.

## AI Assistance Features

The API includes several AI-powered features:

### Project Advice for Managers
```
POST /ai/manager/project-advice
```
Managers can get AI-generated advice for project planning, problem-solving, and best practices.

### Construction Help for Workers
```
POST /ai/worker/construction-help
```
Workers can get AI assistance with construction techniques, including the ability to upload images of construction issues.

### Progress Analysis for Clients
```

```
Clients can ask questions about their project's progress and get clear, non-technical explanations.

### Financial Verification
```
POST /ai/verify-transaction
```

## Role-Based Access Control

The API enforces role-based access control with three primary roles:

1. **Manager**: Full access to create and manage projects, inventory, expenses, and view all data.
2. **Worker**: Can view assigned projects, request inventory items, and report material usage.
3. **Client**: Can view their own projects, track progress, and verify expenses.

## Error Handling

All endpoints follow a consistent error handling pattern and return appropriate HTTP status codes:

- **400**: Bad Request - Invalid input data
- **401**: Unauthorized - Missing or invalid authentication
- **403**: Forbidden - Not enough permissions
- **404**: Not Found - Resource not found
- **500**: Internal Server Error - Server-side error
